The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I was travelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!'},\n",

You can't get any better than that.  The apartment has all the conveniences of a home - everything you'd need in a kitchen, extremely comfortable mattress, cable TV, air conditioning, wifi, great water pressure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGreata goes way out of her way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

There is a subway on the same street as the apartment, a two minute walk away (the 1 line) and multiple places to eat close by. There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge. I hope to continue to stay here every time I visit New York! \"},\n",

On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport.

       "  'comments': 'We had a really great time at Greta’s apartment! First of all she was very nice with us since the beggining, helping with all our doubts. The apartment is near of Central Park and a lot of stores and restaurants. It’s a calm local neighborhood, to live your days in the city like a real new yorker :) . The place was very clean, the shower was good and beds was confortable. The heater sistem worked very well and kept us warm always - it was very important, because the temperatures was very low during our stay there. We definetelly recomend this place to stay! '},\n",
